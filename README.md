# The Anatomy of a Trending YouTube Video

## Story Pitch
YouTube is one of the largest and longest-standing video social media platforms in the world. As of 2023, YouTube has around 2.6 billion active users, 3.7 million video uploads per day by creators worldwide, and over 122 million people accessing the site each day. YouTube is a one-stop place for people, where they can find news updates, educational content, tutorials, movies, vlogs, and many more. Throughout the millions of videos uploaded each day, it is fascinating to think about how some videos go viral and generate high engagement while others struggle to get views. This made us wonder: what factors contribute to the success or popularity of a YouTube video? In this project, we will analyze YouTube data related to likes, shares, saves, comments, video category, length, and posting time in relation to how well they perform or trend. We will also analyze the most subscribed channels to observe how well their videos perform and their engagement rate across multiple platforms.


Our project aims to visualize the factors that contribute to the popularity of videos on YouTube and observe the consumption patterns of users. We will achieve this by comparing and contrasting data, identifying patterns, and observing how these factors evolve and relate to each other.  This is an interesting story to tell because it will allow content creators to understand their audience and tailor their content to increase engagement. By analyzing the unique characteristics of the videos that have generated high engagement, we can understand the formula for creating viral videos and replicating the success. In addition to that, knowing what makes a YouTube video popular will improve trend forecasting, as content creators will be able to stay ahead of the curve and produce relevant content that caters to their audiences.


This project will also look into how YouTube’s algorithm affects how well videos perform and how the users operate. Understanding the platform’s algorithm is imperative for creators who are trying to increase their visibility on the surface, and reach of their content. Furthermore, we noticed how it is essential for content creators to ride the waves of the current trend — to understand and adapt to the ever-changing landscape of YouTube and digital media. Amid political turmoil, environmental catastrophes, and the not-long-past-global pandemics, the ability of content creators to engage with their audience and remain relevant has become increasingly important. 


This study's purpose stems from YouTube being the preeminent platform for entertainment and learning in this contemporary world. This project will examine what makes a YouTube video viral, the engagement of content creators as well as the impact of events on YouTube video categories, to identify the trends and patterns, alteration in focus, and uncover mechanisms and their resulting impacts on the content consumption patterns of users and the role of YouTube’s algorithm in influencing how well videos perform.
